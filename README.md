This is a fullstack Realtime Chat created using Chat Engine.
Chat Engine is an API which makes it easy to build chat services.
Chat Engine provides a Rest API to host your chats, and NPM components to help with your Chat UI.
To start the project, you need to run Nodemon in the terminal of the backend folder with the "npm run start" command
Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
Also, in the terminal of the frontend folder, you need to register the command "npm run dev" and open the desired page
Thats all :)
